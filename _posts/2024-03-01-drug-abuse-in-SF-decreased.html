   In the recent years, the issue of CO2 emission has become a big topic in the world, 
   presenting a significant challenge for politicians and environmental advocates. 
   Like many regions worldwide, the European nations have worked hard to decrease CO2 emission
   to reduce the effects of climate change.

</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">A Historical Analysis of CO2 Emissions in Europe</h2>

<p> The journey into understanding CO2 emission begins with looking into historical data,
    shown through a line plot. The line plot showcases the CO2 emission from 1960 to 2022, revealing a 
    remarkable increase in 1979 and a notable decrease afterwards with the lowest levels of CO2 emission in 2020

<p>
    In 1979, a huge increase in CO2 emission occured. The second oil crisis happened in 1979,
    which was an aftermaath of the Iranian revolution. It was the disruption in oil production from Iran 
    that caused the decline in global supply. Because of the shortage of oil and increase of energy prices, 
    the world started to shift the energy production away from oil to coal. The transition 
    meant that CO2 emission increased, because coal produces more CO2 emissions per unit of energy compared 
    to oil. The second oil crisis was a global issue, where EU countries heavily 
    relied on oil imports for energy, transportation, and industry.  
    Now if we take a closer look into 1979 through a map plot, we see that countries 
    such as Germany, Poland and France had high CO2 emission, where Germany had the highest.

    </p>
<h4 >What happened in 1979</h4>
In 1979, Germany faced some factors that contributed to its high CO2 emissions.
At that time, Germany highly relied on coal for its energy production, which stemmed from 
a combination of historical factors and the countries industrial landscape. As Germany is one of 
Europe's leading industrial powers, with it's strong manufacturing sector, including steel production, chemical manufacturing, and cement production 
resulted in significant CO2 emissions.  
    
    <!--we saw a big increase in energy use, which can be blamed on the rise in industry. 
    It was all about chasing growth and progress, which meant that we were burning through resources like 
    there was no tomorrow. Now if we take a closer look into 1990, focusing on CO2 emission 
    across european countries, then we see some countries standing out. 
    Countries such as Luxembourg, Estonia, Germany and Finland are some of the frontrunners, with 
    Luxembourg topping the charts for the highest CO2 emission that year. 
Turmoil, which was one of the major petruleum
    exporting, that derived from Iran and caused the global supply to decline significantly. 
    Because of the significant decline, meant that global supply of gasoline and diesel fuel were the 
    energy that seleveral countries ended up using. -->

    Although Germany had significant CO2 emissions in 1979, 
    Malta, Cyprus and Slovenia stood out among the European countries for their low CO2 emissions during the same period, 
    where Malta had the lowest CO2 emissions that year. Malta is a relatively small country with 
    a small population of people and a less industrialized economy compared to other European countries.

<!--<p>
    Despite Luxembourg's significant CO2 emissions in 199, 
    Portugal stood out among European nations for its notably low carbon footprint during the same period.
    Portugal industrial sector was less developed in 1990, and didn't have as much or close to 
    the more carbon-intesive countries like Luxembourg or Germany.
    Furthermore Portugal is a country that uses hydroelectric power, so back then they most likely
    also used electricity from hydropower. These factors contributed to the small portion of CO2 emission.
    This reduction can be attributed to advancements 
    in renewable energy technologies, stricter environmental regulations, and awareness of climate change impacts.

<h2 class="section-heading">Steps Towards Reduction</h2>
<p> Despite the alarming rise in emissions in 1979, the years afterwards has shown a gradual decline in CO2 emissions as 
    seen in the line plot.
    Notably in 2020, where the CO2 emissions hit the lowest level in EU. 
    In 2020 the world was hit by a pandemic known as COVID 19, which slowed down 
    the global economy, resulting in a decrease in CO2 emissions.

     <h2 class="section-heading">What can we learn</h2>

<h2 class="section-heading"> Looking Ahead: Shifting focus and challenges</h2>
<!--https://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle/2011/oct/31/sf_de_facto_drug_decriminalization-->
<p>Former San Francisco Police Chief and district attorney George Gascon's, approaches drug
enforcement with a strategic shift towards targeting mid-level drug dealers and offenses associated with violent crimes.
We see a decline in drug arrests, signaling a shifting landscape in drug enforcement strategies.


Professor Craig Reinarman of UC Santa Cruz also highlights that historically, the majority of the drug related arrests have targeted
petty offenses, which correlates to the large amount of drug offenses before 2010 and now the drastic
decrease. Also in 2014, California voters approved Prop 47, a measure reducing drug possession from a felony to a misdemeanor, further impacting the data landscape. <!--https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/31/upshot/san-francisco-drug-crisis.html-->
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Moving Forward</h2>
<p> However, it's important to note a potential error in the data interpretation
    stemming from these changes. While the data reflects a decrease in drug-related incidents,
    the true reason behind this decline may be attributed to the shift in strategy rather than an actual reduction in drug offenses.
    Consequently, while the data indicates a decrease, it may not accurately represent the extent of ongoing drug-related issues,
    as they are now viewed differently in the eyes of the law enforcement system.
</p>

<p>
As we navigate through these changing dynamics, 
it's important to consider both numbers and people's experiences.
By having open dialogues, working together and using strategies backed by evidence,
we can better tackle dryg-related issues in San Francisco and elsewhere and move more effective
