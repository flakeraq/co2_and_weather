   In the recent years, the issue of CO2 emission has become a big topic in the world, 
   presenting a significant challenge for policemakers and environmental advocates. 
   Like many regions worldwide, the European nations have worked hard to decrease CO2 emission
   to reduce the effects of climate change.

<h2 class="section-heading">A Historical Analysis of CO2 Emissions in Europe</h2>

<p> The journey into understanding CO2 emission begins with looking into historical data,
    shown through a line plot. The line plot showcases the CO2 emission from 1960 to 2018, revealing a 
    remarkable increase in 1990 and a notable decrease afterwards with the lowest levels of CO2 emission in 2015

<h4 >Understanding the peaks</h4>
<p>
    In 1990, we saw a big increase in energy use, which can be blamed on the rise in industry. 
    It was all about chasing growth and progress, which meant that we were burning through resources like 
    there was no tomorrow. Now if we take a closer look into 1990, focusing on CO2 emission 
    across european countries, then we see some countries standing out. 
    Countries such as Luxembourg, Estonia, Germany and Finland are some of the frontrunners, with 
    Luxembourg topping the charts for the highest CO2 emission that year.

    Luxembough is a country with diverse industrial base, including steel production,
    which was a major reason for the CO2 emissions in 1990. The steel industry, has high
    energy consumption and reliance on fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural
    gas for its energy needs. Furthermore the small country has significant 
    vehicular traffic, leading increased consumption and emissions from vehicles.
    All of these factors was the reason behind the amount of CO2 emission in Luxembourg.
</p>

<p>
    Despite Luxembourg's significant CO2 emissions in 1990, 
    Portugal stood out among European nations for its notably low carbon footprint during the same period.
    Portugal industrial sector was less developed in 1990, and didn't have as much or close to 
    the more carbon-intesive countries like Luxembourg or Germany.
    Furthermore Portugal is a country that uses hydroelectric power, so back then they most likely
    also used electricity from hydropower. These factors contributed to the small portion of CO2 emission
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Steps Towards Reduction</h2>
<p> Despite the alarming rise in emissions in 1990, the years afterwards shown a gradual decline.
    This reduction can be attributed to advancements 
    in renewable energy technologies, stricter environmental regulations, and awareness of climate change impacts.
     </p>

<h2 class="section-heading"> Looking Ahead: Shifting focus and challenges</h2>
<!--https://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle/2011/oct/31/sf_de_facto_drug_decriminalization-->
<p>Former San Francisco Police Chief and district attorney George Gascon's, approaches drug
enforcement with a strategic shift towards targeting mid-level drug dealers and offenses associated with violent crimes.
We see a decline in drug arrests, signaling a shifting landscape in drug enforcement strategies.


Professor Craig Reinarman of UC Santa Cruz also highlights that historically, the majority of the drug related arrests have targeted
petty offenses, which correlates to the large amount of drug offenses before 2010 and now the drastic
decrease. Also in 2014, California voters approved Prop 47, a measure reducing drug possession from a felony to a misdemeanor, further impacting the data landscape. <!--https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/31/upshot/san-francisco-drug-crisis.html-->
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Moving Forward</h2>
<p> However, it's important to note a potential error in the data interpretation
    stemming from these changes. While the data reflects a decrease in drug-related incidents,
    the true reason behind this decline may be attributed to the shift in strategy rather than an actual reduction in drug offenses.
    Consequently, while the data indicates a decrease, it may not accurately represent the extent of ongoing drug-related issues,
    as they are now viewed differently in the eyes of the law enforcement system.
</p>

<p>
As we navigate through these changing dynamics, 
it's important to consider both numbers and people's experiences.
By having open dialogues, working together and using strategies backed by evidence,
we can better tackle dryg-related issues in San Francisco and elsewhere and move more effective
