<p>In the recent years, CO2 emission has become a big topic in the world,
    a significant challenge for policymakers and environmental advocates.Like many 
    regions worldwide, the European nations have worked hard to decrease CO2 emissions quickly 
    to reduce the effects of climate change.

</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">Understanding the History</h2>

<p> The journey begins by looking at the historical data, represented by a line plot showcasing the 
    total CO2 emission in Europe each year from 1960 to 2018. 
    By looking at the plot we observe a huge increase in  CO2 emission in 1990, where the lowest
    CO2 emission in EU after 1990 was in 2015.

<span class="caption text-muted">Understanding the Peaks</span>
<p>
    Why did CO2 emissions peak in 1990, and why were they at their lowest in 2015 afterwards?.
    In 1990, there happened an industrial expasion, where energy consumption icreased, and a growing
    reliance on fossil fuels during this period.

</p>
<p>
    Following the year of 1990's peak, a significant deacrease in CO2 emission occured, 
    marking a notable achievement in Europe CO2 emissions. When we dive into 1990 and look at the map, we see that Luxembourg had the highest CO2 emission in 1990. 

</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Steps Towards Reduction</h2>
<p> Despite the alarming rise in emissions in 1990, the years afterwards shown a gradual decline.
    This reduction can be attributed to advancements 
    in renewable energy technologies, stricter environmental regulations, and awareness of climate change impacts.
     </p>


<p> All the concerns about reliability and credibility of drug-related evidence influenced the effectiveness of the law enforcement efforts.
</p>

<p>While the scandal exposed vulnerability in the San Francisco law enforcement, it also served as a catalyst
    for change and enhanced the city's responce to drug-related issues.

<h2 class="section-heading"> Looking Ahead: Shifting focus and challenges</h2>
<!--https://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle/2011/oct/31/sf_de_facto_drug_decriminalization-->
<p>Former San Francisco Police Chief and district attorney George Gascon's, approaches drug
enforcement with a strategic shift towards targeting mid-level drug dealers and offenses associated with violent crimes.
We see a decline in drug arrests, signaling a shifting landscape in drug enforcement strategies.


Professor Craig Reinarman of UC Santa Cruz also highlights that historically, the majority of the drug related arrests have targeted
petty offenses, which correlates to the large amount of drug offenses before 2010 and now the drastic
decrease. Also in 2014, California voters approved Prop 47, a measure reducing drug possession from a felony to a misdemeanor, further impacting the data landscape. <!--https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/31/upshot/san-francisco-drug-crisis.html-->
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Moving Forward</h2>
<p> However, it's important to note a potential error in the data interpretation
    stemming from these changes. While the data reflects a decrease in drug-related incidents,
    the true reason behind this decline may be attributed to the shift in strategy rather than an actual reduction in drug offenses.
    Consequently, while the data indicates a decrease, it may not accurately represent the extent of ongoing drug-related issues,
    as they are now viewed differently in the eyes of the law enforcement system.
</p>

<p>
As we navigate through these changing dynamics, 
it's important to consider both numbers and people's experiences.
By having open dialogues, working together and using strategies backed by evidence,
we can better tackle dryg-related issues in San Francisco and elsewhere and move more effective
