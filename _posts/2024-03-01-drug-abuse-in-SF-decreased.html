<p>
   In the recent years, the issue of CO2 emission has become a big topic in the world, 
   presenting a significant challenge for politicians and environmental advocates. 
   Like many regions worldwide, the European countries have worked hard to decrease CO2 emission
   to reduce the effects of climate change.

</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">A Historical Analysis of CO2 Emissions in Europe</h2>

<p> The journey into understanding CO2 emission begins with looking into historical data,
    shown through a line plot. The line plot showcases the CO2 emission from 1960 to 2022, revealing a 
    remarkable increase in 1979 and a notable decrease afterwards with the lowest levels of CO2 emission in 2020.

    The plot is an overview of Europe's CO2 Emission Journey from 1960 to 2022. 
    The y-axis represents the total co2 emission, while the x-axis represents every year from 1960-2022. 
    Each peak is colored in red dots, while each valley is colored in green. 
    The highest CO2 emission occurred in 1979, while the lowest CO2 emission occurred in 2020.

<h4 >1979: The Second Oil Crisis and Industrial Impacts</h4>
<p>
    In 1979, a huge increase in CO2 emission occured. The second oil crisis happened in <a href="https://history.aip.org/climate/public.htm#L_M045">1979</a>,
    which was an aftermath of the Iranian revolution. It was the disruption in oil production from Iran 
    that caused the decline in global supply, since the Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeni 
    <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-349-07765-6_3">decided to cut the export by 50 percent</a> to force most governments of the oil-consuming countries to take the energy problem seriously.
    Because of the shortage of oil, the energy prices increased and
    the world started to shift the energy production away from oil to coal. The transition 
    meant that CO2 emission increased, because coal produces more CO2 emissions per unit of energy compared 
    to oil. The second oil crisis was a global issue, where EU countries heavily 
    relied on oil imports for energy, transportation, and industry.  
    </p>
<p>
    Now if we take a closer look into 1979 through a map plot, we see that countries 
    such as Germany, Poland, France and Italy had high CO2 emission. 
    These countries are <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Industrial_production_statistics">all industrialized countries </a>, facing similar battles in decreasing CO2 emission levels,
    where Germany is the EU country with the highest CO2 emissions at that time.

<h4>Comparative Analysis of CO2 Emissions Across Europe</h4>
    <p>
In 1979, Germany faced some factors that contributed to its high CO2 emissions, such as the second oil crisis.
Because of the crisis, Germany transitioned to coal and highly relied on it for its energy production. Since Germany is 
a industrial country, the increase of CO2 emission was a combination of historical factors and the countries industrial landscape. 
</p>

<p>
    Additionally, the structure of Germany's economy, emphazised heavily on industries such as 
    steel production, chemical manufacturing, and cement production, which generates higher 
    CO2 emissions compared to other countries with less industrialized economies. 
</p>
<p>
    While Germany's CO2 emissions were influenced by the countries industrial landscape and historical factors, 
    it's essetial to contrast this with the emissions of other European countries, with less CO2 emissions. 
    Malta, Cyprus and Portugal stood out among the European countries for their low CO2 emissions during the same period, 
    where Malta had the lowest CO2 emissions that year. 
</p>

<p>
    Malta is a relatively small country with a small population, and a less industrialized economy compared to larger European countries,
    such as Germany. With Malta having less heavy industries such as steel production, chemical manufactoring, and cement production, Malta's carbon 
    footprint was much lower. 
</p>

<p> 
    Similarly, countries like Portugal and Cyprus with their less industrialized economies, resulting in less CO2 emission levels. 
</p>

<!--<p>
    Despite Luxembourg's significant CO2 emissions in 199, 
    Portugal stood out among European nations for its notably low carbon footprint during the same period.
    Portugal industrial sector was less developed in 1990, and didn't have as much or close to 
    the more carbon-intesive countries like Luxembourg or Germany.
    Furthermore Portugal is a country that uses hydroelectric power, so back then they most likely
    also used electricity from hydropower. These factors contributed to the small portion of CO2 emission.
    This reduction can be attributed to advancements 
    in renewable energy technologies, stricter environmental regulations, and awareness of climate change impacts.
</p> -->

<!--<h4 >Steps Towards Reduction</h4>
<p>
    Despite the alarming rise in emissions in 1979, the years afterwards has shown a gradual decline in CO2 emissions as 
    seen in the line plot. 
</p>
-->
<h4 >Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on CO2 Emissions</h4>
<p> As seen in the <a href="#lineplot">line plot</a>, a notable dip occured in 2020, where the CO2 emissions hit the lowest level in EU after 1979. 
    In 2020 the world was hit by a pandemic known as COVID 19, which <a href="https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/jrc-news-and-updates/global-co2-emissions-rebound-2021-after-temporary-reduction-during-covid19-lockdown-2022-10-14_en">slowed down 
    the global economy, which caused the CO2 emission levels to decrease. </a>

    the closer it is to blue, the lower the CO2 emission level. 
    When hovering over the country, you can get a overview of the year, country and CO2 emission.
</span>

<p> Due to the quarantines in the covid 19 pandemic, changes in consumer behavior and lifestyle choices occured, 
    which influenced energy consumption patterns and emission levels. 
    <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10281825/">A notable phenomenon was the shift towards remote work, which meant a decrease in transportation related emissions. </a>
</p>
<p>
    When taking a closer look at the map plot, Germany still remains the country with the highest CO2 emission, while Malta 
    continues to be the country with the lowest level of CO2 emissions. Despite the countries still 
    holding their spots, both countries still experienced a reduction in CO2 emissions. 
</p>

<h4 >Steps Towards Reduction: Germany's Initiatives</h4>
<p>
    There has been a noticecable decrease over the years in Germany, when it comes to CO2 emission, which 
    can be seen through the <a href="#lineplot_Germany">line plot</a>. This decline reflects the efforts in adressing the issue of climate change.

    The y-axis represents the total co2 emission, while the x-axis represents every year from 1960-2022. 
    The highest CO2 emission occurred in 1979, while the lowest CO2 emission occurred in 2020. 
</span>
<p>
Germany has implemented a series of initiatives aimed to reduce CO2 emissions to transition 
towards a more sustainable energy landscape. Germany has decided to <a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-en/issues/climate-action/government-climate-policy-1779414">increase 
the pricing for the transport sector and for heating buildings</a>. They are actively promoting the use of 
energy-saving buildings, renewables and alternative technology in the transportation sector, such as electric mobility. 
In 2021, companies were required to pay a CO2 price, where Germany changed the pricing of fossil fuels such 
as oil, gas, petrol and diesel.
As for 2019, about 43 percent of electric power was generated 
from renewable soruces, such as wind and solar power. Since 2020, home owners have also had the 
opportunity to receive a payment for replacing old oil central heating, further reducing the CO2 emissions. 
</p>

<p>
Moreover, Germany has been exploring and implementing a series of initiatives, 
showing the strong commitment to reduce CO2 emissions. Currently, their plan is to 
reduce greenhouse gas emission by <a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-en/issues/climate-action/government-climate-policy-1779414">55 percent by 2030</a>, 
by stop using coal to generate electic power and restructure their mobility. 
</p>

<h4 >Shaping a Sustainable Future</h4>

<p> As we navigate the complexities of the 21st century, it's important
    to recognize the historical events and the CO2 emissions. By learning from 
    the past and getting insights from the historical analysis, 
    we can get a deeper understanding of how future events might impact CO2 emissions. 
    With this knowledge we are better equipped to anticipate the challenges and 
    also opportunites that lie ahead of us. 

    Trough strategic policy interventions, investments in renewable 
    energy and adaption measures, we can move towards a more sustainable future. 
    By investing in renewable energy infrastructure, such as solar and wind power or 
    prioritizing adaption measures such as transitioning to low-carbon transportation option, 
    can help lower the CO2 emission levels. 


<!--Even though we see that each peaks are based on historical events, we do see through
the line plot that the overall CO2 emission in europe has had a more declining effect, than
a growing one. These historical events serve as a reminder of the political dynamics, energy policies and 
environmental consequences. The events shows the importance of diversed energy sources, 
promoting renewable technologies -->
</p>

<p>
    Ultimately, the lessons drawn from Europ's CO2 emission 
    history serve as a reminder to take action. As we navigate into the dynamics of climate change, 
    the relationship between CO2 emissions and its potential effects on global weather patterns becomes apparent. 
</p>

<p>
    In the next blog, we will look into extreme weather events and explore 
    if CO2 emissions can potentially affect climate conditions.
