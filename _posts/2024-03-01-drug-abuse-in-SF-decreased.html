<p>
   In the recent years, the issue of CO2 emission has become a big topic in the world, 
   presenting a significant challenge for policemakers and environmental advocates. 
   Like many regions worldwide, the European nations have worked hard to decrease CO2 emission
   to reduce the effects of climate change.

</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">A Historical Analysis of CO2 Emissions in Europe</h2>

<p> The journey into understanding CO2 emission begins with looking into historical data,
    shown through a line plot. The line plot showcases the CO2 emission from 1960 to 2018, revealing a 
    remarkable increase in 1990 and a notable decrease afterwards with the lowest levels of CO2 emission in 2015

<h4 >Understanding the peaks</h4>
<p>
    The spike in 1990 can be based on the industrial expasion, where energy consumption icreased, 
    and a growing reliance on fossil fuels during this period.

<p>
    Following the year of 1990's peak, a significant deacrease in CO2 emission occured, 
    marking a notable achievement in Europe CO2 emissions. When we dive into 1990 and look at the map, we see that Luxembourg had the highest CO2 emission in 1990.

<h2 class="section-heading">Steps Towards Reduction</h2>
<p> Despite the alarming rise in emissions in 1990, the years afterwards shown a gradual decline.
    This reduction can be attributed to advancements 
    in renewable energy technologies, stricter environmental regulations, and awareness of climate change impacts.
     </p>
<p> All the concerns about reliability and credibility of drug-related evidence influenced the effectiveness of the law enforcement efforts.
</p>

<p>While the scandal exposed vulnerability in the San Francisco law enforcement, it also served as a catalyst
    for change and enhanced the city's responce to drug-related issues.

<h2 class="section-heading"> Looking Ahead: Shifting focus and challenges</h2>
<!--https://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle/2011/oct/31/sf_de_facto_drug_decriminalization-->
<p>Former San Francisco Police Chief and district attorney George Gascon's, approaches drug
enforcement with a strategic shift towards targeting mid-level drug dealers and offenses associated with violent crimes.
We see a decline in drug arrests, signaling a shifting landscape in drug enforcement strategies.


Professor Craig Reinarman of UC Santa Cruz also highlights that historically, the majority of the drug related arrests have targeted
petty offenses, which correlates to the large amount of drug offenses before 2010 and now the drastic
decrease. Also in 2014, California voters approved Prop 47, a measure reducing drug possession from a felony to a misdemeanor, further impacting the data landscape. <!--https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/31/upshot/san-francisco-drug-crisis.html-->
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Moving Forward</h2>
<p> However, it's important to note a potential error in the data interpretation
    stemming from these changes. While the data reflects a decrease in drug-related incidents,
    the true reason behind this decline may be attributed to the shift in strategy rather than an actual reduction in drug offenses.
    Consequently, while the data indicates a decrease, it may not accurately represent the extent of ongoing drug-related issues,
    as they are now viewed differently in the eyes of the law enforcement system.
</p>

<p>
As we navigate through these changing dynamics, 
it's important to consider both numbers and people's experiences.
By having open dialogues, working together and using strategies backed by evidence,
we can better tackle dryg-related issues in San Francisco and elsewhere and move more effective
