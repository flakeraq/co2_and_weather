   In the recent years, the issue of CO2 emission has become a big topic in the world, 
   presenting a significant challenge for politicians and environmental advocates. 
   Like many regions worldwide, the European nations have worked hard to decrease CO2 emission
   to reduce the effects of climate change.

</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">A Historical Analysis of CO2 Emissions in Europe</h2>

<p> The journey into understanding CO2 emission begins with looking into historical data,
    shown through a line plot. The line plot showcases the CO2 emission from 1960 to 2022, revealing a 
    remarkable increase in 1979 and a notable decrease afterwards with the lowest levels of CO2 emission in 2020

<h4 >Taking a trip down memory lane</h4>
<p>
    In 1979, a huge increase in CO2 emission occured. The second oil crisis happened in 1979,
    which was an aftermaath of the Iranian revolution. It was the disruption in oil production from Iran 
    that caused the decline in global supply. Because of the shortage of oil and increase of energy prices, 
    the world started to shift the energy production away from oil to coal. The transition 
    meant that CO2 emission increased, because coal produces more CO2 emissions per unit of energy compared 
    to oil. The second oil crisis was a global issue, where EU countries heavily 
    relied on oil imports for energy, transportation, and industry.  
    Now if we take a closer look into 1979 through a map plot, we see that countries 
    such as Germany, Poland and France had high CO2 emission, where Germany had the highest CO2 emissions.

    </p>
<h4 >Breaking down 1979</h4>
In 1979, Germany faced some factors that contributed to its high CO2 emissions.
At that time, Germany highly relied on coal for its energy production, which stemmed from 
a combination of historical factors and the countries industrial landscape. As Germany is one of 
Europe's leading industrial powers, with it's strong manufacturing sector, including steel production, chemical manufacturing, and cement production,
then it also makes sense that they have a quite high level of CO2 emissions compared to other countries. 
    
    <!--we saw a big increase in energy use, which can be blamed on the rise in industry. 
    It was all about chasing growth and progress, which meant that we were burning through resources like 
    there was no tomorrow. Now if we take a closer look into 1990, focusing on CO2 emission 
    across european countries, then we see some countries standing out. 
    Countries such as Luxembourg, Estonia, Germany and Finland are some of the frontrunners, with 
    Luxembourg topping the charts for the highest CO2 emission that year. 
Turmoil, which was one of the major petruleum
    exporting, that derived from Iran and caused the global supply to decline significantly. 
    Because of the significant decline, meant that global supply of gasoline and diesel fuel were the 
    energy that seleveral countries ended up using. -->

<p>
    Although Germany had significant CO2 emissions in 1979, 
    Malta, Cyprus and Slovenia stood out among the European countries for their low CO2 emissions during the same period, 
    where Malta had the lowest CO2 emissions that year. Malta is a relatively small country with 
    a small population of people and a less industrialized economy compared to other European countries.
    Malta..
</p>

<!--<p>
    Despite Luxembourg's significant CO2 emissions in 199, 
    Portugal stood out among European nations for its notably low carbon footprint during the same period.
    Portugal industrial sector was less developed in 1990, and didn't have as much or close to 
    the more carbon-intesive countries like Luxembourg or Germany.
    Furthermore Portugal is a country that uses hydroelectric power, so back then they most likely
    also used electricity from hydropower. These factors contributed to the small portion of CO2 emission.
    This reduction can be attributed to advancements 
    in renewable energy technologies, stricter environmental regulations, and awareness of climate change impacts.
</p> -->

<!--<h4 >Steps Towards Reduction</h4>
<p>
    Despite the alarming rise in emissions in 1979, the years afterwards has shown a gradual decline in CO2 emissions as 
    seen in the line plot. 
</p>
-->
<h4 >A Pandemic Pause</h4>
<p> Notably in 2020, where the CO2 emissions hit the lowest level in EU. 
    In 2020 the world was hit by a pandemic known as COVID 19, which slowed down 
    the global economy, resulting in a decrease in CO2 emissions. 
    
</p>

{% include CO2_Emission_EU_Map_Online_2020.html %}
<span class="caption text-muted">Europe's CO2 Emission in 2020</span>

<p> Due to the quarantines in the covid 19 pandemic, changes in consumer behavior and lifestyle choices occured, 
    which influenced energy consumption patterns and emission levels. Many people shifted towards remote 
    work, which meant a reduction in transportation resulting in reduction in CO2 emission levels.
    When we once again take a look into the CO2 emission in 2020, we see that Germany is once again the country with the highest CO2 emission, while Malta is once again 
    the country with the lowest level of CO2 emissions. Even though the two countrie's spots remain the same, 
    we still do see a decrease of CO2 emissions in both countries, which makes sense based on the 
    circumstances around those events. 

</p>
<h4 >Steps Towards Reduction</h4>
<p>
    Even though Germany still maintain its position as the EU country with the 
    highest CO2 emission level, there has been a noticecable decrease over the years, which 
    can be seen through the line plot. This decline reflects the efforts in adressing the issue of climate change. 
</p>

<p>
Germany has implemented a series of initiatives aimed to reduce CO2 emissions to transition 
towards a more sustainable energy landscape. Germany has decide to <a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-en/issues/climate-action/government-climate-policy-1779414">increase 
the pricing for the transport sector and for heating buildings</a> They are actively promoting the use of 
energy-saving buildings, renewables and alternative technology in the transportation sector, such as electric mobility. 
In 2021, they changed the pricing of fossil fuels such as oil, gas, petrol and diesel, so companies were 
required to pay a CO2 price. 

As for 2019 about 43 percent of electric power was generated 
from renewable soruces, such as wind and solar power. Since 2020, home owners have also had the 
opportunity to receive a payment for replacing old oil central heating, further reducing the CO2 emissions. 
</p>

<p>
Moreover, Germany has been exploring and implementing a series of initiatives, 
showing the strong commitment to reduce CO2 emissions. Currently, their plan is to 
reduce greenhouse gas emission by 55 percent by 2030, 
by stop using coal to generate electic power and restructure their mobility. 
</p>

<h4 >Shaping a future</h4>

<p> As we navigate the complexities of the 21st century, it's important
    to recognize the historical events and the CO2 emissions. By learning from 
    the past and getting insights from the historical analysis, 
    we can get a deeper understanding of how future events might impact CO2 emissions. 
    With this knowledge we are better equopped to anticipate the challenges and 
    also opportunites that lie ahead of us. 

    Trough strategic policy interventions, investments in renewable 
    energy and adaption measures, we can move towards a more sustainable future. 
    By investing in renewable energy infrastructure, such as solar and wind power or 
    prioritizing adaption measures such as transitioning to low-carbon transportation option, 
    can help lower the CO2 emission levels. 


<!--Even though we see that each peaks are based on historical events, we do see through
the line plot that the overall CO2 emission in europe has had a more declining effect, than
a growing one. These historical events serve as a reminder of the political dynamics, energy policies and 
environmental consequences. The events shows the importance of diversed energy sources, 
promoting renewable technologies -->
</p>

<p>
    Ultimately, the lessions drawn from Europ's CO2 emission history serve as a reminder to take action.
