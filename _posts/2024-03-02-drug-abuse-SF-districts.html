<p> In a world where the mitigation of drugs is a difficult but necessary task, we delve into the topic of drug abuse within San Francisco's districts,
    illustrated by geographical data. 
     We want to highight the different levels of drug-related incidents observed across neighborhoods,
     giving an attempt to uncover the societal factors underlying these variations.</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">Exploring Drug Incidents: Unveiling San Francisco's Districts with the Highest Records</h2>
{% include geo_map.html %}
<p>The map clearly shows that the Tenderloin area in San Francisco has the highest 
    number of drug-related incidents compared to other districts from 2003 to 2017,
     totaling 16,719 incidents illustrated with a bright red in the map. This is significantly higher than the district with
      the lowest number of drug incidents, which is Richmond, with only 897 incidents 
      during the same period, illustrating with the richest green color. This could be more difficult to pin out
      as several districts have a lower drug abuse record. The significant prominence of Tenderloin prompts us to examine potential contributing factors.</p>
     
      <p>Researching the district Tenderloin, it is found that the median household income is $39,134, slightly
       exceeding half of the national median income. Approximately one-third of the population, nearly 35,000 people, 
       earn below the federal poverty level. Moreover, only 7% of residents own homes, whereas around one-third of the 
       entire city's residents are homeowners. This indicates a notable gap in homeownership between the Tenderloin and the rest of the city,
    with the majority either renting homes or being homeless. </p>
    <p> In fact, about 60% of San Francisco's homeless population resides in the Tenderloin,
      which is approximately 4,400 people. Addressing homelessness in the Tenderloin often involves addressing drug abuse as well. 
      While not every homeless person is an addict, it cannot be excluded that drug abuse is commonly seen among the homeless.</p>
<p> Tenderloin, when not considering, is considered ground zero for San Francisco's open-air drug market, with visible drug use and sales, along with issues like human waste, 
    used needles, and bullet casings scattered on the sidewalks. The recent years have seen a spike in drug abuse and drug dealing, claiming a record number of lives which calls for immediate action by the district.
</p>

<p>
    Turning to the district with the lowest drug records, RICHMOND, it stands out for its higher median income of around $88,574, making it one of the wealthier areas in San Francisco. 
    Additionally, with a population of over 80,000 people, it's home to many families.
    The low crime rate in Richmond contributes to its reputation as a safe and welcoming place to live, where homelessness is not a significant issue. 
</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">Initiatives Transforming San Francisco's Tenderloin District</h2>
<p>
    Efforts have been made to improve the current state in Tenderloin, including outreach programs that provide clean supplies and promote safer drug use while building trust with drug users to encourage seeking help. 
    These programs also aim to connect homeless individuals with shelters and support services. Additionally, initiatives such as The Tenderloin Community Benefit District focus on street cleanliness and graffiti removal 
    to clean up the neighborhood.

        "And their sickness has them where they're not making decisions you and I would think of the right ones. That's why they're out here. And that's why we keep coming back to try to catch them at the right time, when they're ready to do something different"
        said Mark Mazza with the san Francisco Department of Emergency Management.  
    </blockquote> 
    Mazza and his team also provide clean syringes, glass pipes, alcohol wipes and bottles of water, 
    as they aim to give people the health tools to make drug use as safe as possible. They are not supporting addicts being addicts 
    but seeing reality for what it is and meeting the addicts halfway while working towards building the trust that drug users may need to eventually seek help and 
    making a life turning decision. 
</p>
<p>
    The concerted efforts are translating into numbers. The city is consistently facilitating housing placements for up to 300 individuals each month, sometimes even exceeding this number. While these numbers represent a
    significant increase compared to previous years, not all individuals placed in housing remain there permanently.
</p>

While homelessness is not the only factor contributing to the high number of drug incidents in Tenderloin, it does exacerbate the issue. In contrast, districts like Richmond, which is known to be a family-friendly environment with higher incomes,
 the district tend to have fewer drug-related problems. This highlights the significance of addressing homelessness as a adding cause when trying to combat drug abuse within communities. By offering stable housing and support services, it is a step towards mitigating 
 one of the contributing factors to the causes of substance abuse, thereby promoting healthier and safer neighborhoods.
