<p>This project aims to tell a story based on data, investigating if there is a correlation between CO2 emissions and climate changes.
    By doing so, data of CO2 emissions and climate in both EU and on a global scale has been analysed.</p>
<p>
    To tell the story with data, different ways of representing the data have been used; timeserie to show how EU and the rest of the world has progressed in CO2 emission through the years, bar chart, maps to compare the european contries CO2 emission levels.
    Some of the plots are interactive and some have been made using bokey-graphs. Using an interactive line plot, the progression of natural disasters is highlighted.
    An interactive bar plot complements the line plot by displaying each natural disaster in each year. Additionally, interactive bar plots are employed to compare selected countries in the EU and worldwide in terms of CO2 emissions.</p>
